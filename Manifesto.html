<h1> We are not political</h1>
<p>We do not belong to the form of this state.</p>
<p>We are not concerned with the organization of this state.</p>
<p>We are not part of the administration of this state.</p>
<p>We do not regulate its relations with other states.</p>
<br>
<p>Why have we become political?</p>
<br>
<p>Because we have rejected patriarchy at the highest form. We refuse to confine ourselves in the binary. We move with fluidity and we move beyond the reaches of their minds.</p>
<br>
<p>We free those trapped.</p>
<br>
<p>History repeats itself as Thatcher becomes Sunak. We must not let ourselves be silenced as they silenced our siblings and left them for dead. We know we are not the cause of their failure.</p>
<br>
<p>We only ask to be left alone. Those who support us will support us, but we are not a part of YOUR ideology. We are not a part of your politics. You cannot deny reality. You cannot deny the future.</p>
<br>
<p>Yet we already know.</p>
<br>
<p>THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL US.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>This is not a call to action the way you might assume a manifesto to be, rather, it is a call to inaction. For the government to leave us alone. For gender-affirming care to be fixed, not because we demand it, but because the NHS as a whole should be fixed. The problems with healthcare are not unique to us as trans individuals, rather, the systemic underfunding of the service by people who can afford for it to be underfunded. For people in public bathrooms to just take a piss and leave without staring us down. For crowds of conservative politicians not to cheer when it is asserted that this is bullying. Tell me, how is this bullying?</p>
<br>
<p>We are not rapists. We are not paedophiles. We are not transitioning to get into your single-sex spaces and assault you. The overwhelming amount of us would prefer a gender-neutral space instead because WE feel threatened, as we should. We are the most targeted queer community by hate and assault. We want to be left alone.</p>
<br>
<p>We are all so fucking scared.</p>
<p>I am so fucking scared.</p>
<br>
<p>My friends, we must stay strong. The language of the law includes us in its protections, and the only fight we have is to remain protected. Individuals must meet us and realise we are not a threat. We must stay peacefully vigilant. But we must fight to stop them from killing us the way our brothers were murdered. We must stay.</p>
